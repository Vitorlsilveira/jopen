ABOUT

jopen is a small Netbeans plugin to search and open files fast.
It presents the search results as you type and has a simple directory search.


INSTALLATION

Use the following Netbeans module file:
/build/org-jojo.nbm
I use it for Netbeans 6.9.1


USAGE

I recommend to set up a shortcut (i use ALT+O).
jopen will search only in your "main project", so you will have to set one.

Just enter the filename you are looking for to start a search.

To use the directory search start with a whitespace and then add the initial letters
of the folders followed by the filename:
" p t y fil" will find "/path/to/youre/file.tmp"
